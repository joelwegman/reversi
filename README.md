# Reversi
This is a simple project I'm using to learn Kotlin and a few other technologies.
It's a work in progress, and since it's my first Kotlin project it's likely to
not be the most canonical Kotlin style yet.  PRs are welcome.

## Build/run instructions
`./gradlew jsRun` should build and open the project in a new browser tab.
`./gradlew -t jsRun` should do the same, rebuilding/reloading as changes are made.

## Tests
I ran through the steps outlined in https://kotlinlang.org/docs/js-running-tests.html,
but couldn't get it to work (it looked like a dependency issue related to kotlin.test).
The steps outlined in https://www.jetbrains.com/guide/java/tutorials/writing-junit5-tests/setting-up-gradle-junit5/
didn't work either (in part because the video published on 2021-01-01 references an "Add Gradle Plugin" item in the âŒ˜N menu
that doesn't exist in my IntelliJ installation).

Fortunately, I was able to get Kotest working instead.
`./gradlew check` runs the tests.
